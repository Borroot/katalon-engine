# Katalon engine
A super efficient katalon engine which can solve any state within a minute, usually in a few hundred milliseconds. This is achieved by implementing an efficient search algorithm. The techniques implemented here include: negamax (better known as minmax), alpha-beta pruning, move ordering, transposition table, symmetry generation and MTD(f) a form of null window search.

This project also includes a benchmarker and an interactive terminal interface. In the future it might also implement an openingstable, for which the first steps are already done.

_If_ the algorithms are all implemented correctly katalon is a win for the first player in at most 28 moves.
