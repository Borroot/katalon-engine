Evaluation functions
- Pure negamax: so literally just negamax()
- Binary search: half the window every null window search iteration
- MTD(f)
- Negascout?

Search function characteristics
- Pure negamax
- Alpha beta pruning
- Transposition table
- Bestmove table (killer heuristic)
- Move sorting (prefer full squares)
- Lastmove square sometimes in key
- Symmetry checking at low depths
- Opening table
- Parallelisation

Opening table
- Up to depth 10 there are 269810 unique states.
- Solving one of these takes approximately 130 / 200 = 0.65 seconds.
- So saving all the evaluations for these states takes about (269810 * 0.65) / 3600 = 48 hours.
- Up to depth 9 can now easily be determined by using the available information on depth 10.
