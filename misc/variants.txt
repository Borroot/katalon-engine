Evaluation functions
- Pure negamax: so literally just negamax()
- Binary search: half the window every null window search iteration
- MTD(f)
- Negascout?

Search functions
1. Pure negamax
2. 1. + alpha beta pruning
3. 2. + transposition table
4. 3. + killer moves
5. 4. + move sorting (prefer nonfull squares)
6. 5. + symmetry checking at low depths
7. 6. + opening table

Opening table
- Up to depth 10 there are 269810 unique states.
- Solving one of these takes approximately 130 / 200 = 0.65 seconds.
- So saving all the evaluations for these states takes about (269810 * 0.65) / 3600 = 48 hours.
- Up to depth 9 can now easily be determined by using the available information on depth 10.
